/** SPACE COMPLEXITY
    There are 2 main distinctions to make:
    1.- Input data space: space of the original data
    2.- Auxiliar space: space used for intern processes

    space complexity changes between programming languages and others, so the easier
    way to calculate it is counting the number of variables and its size created 
    during the process.
