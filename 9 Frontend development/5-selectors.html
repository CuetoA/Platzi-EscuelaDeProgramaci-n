    <ul>
        <li>
            Pseudoclass: When a class is under a speciall circunstance, 
            like having the mouse over them or being the first of its class. 
            The important part is that they act as if they were a new class 
            applyied on a certian element.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pseudoelements: They work very similar to pseudocalsses, but instead 
            the act as if they were complete new HTML elements
