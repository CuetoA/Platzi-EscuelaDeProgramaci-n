Sorting algorithms:
- Buble sort: Compares two elements and exchange them over and over again O(n**2)
- Merge sort: Divides the elements over and over again until having arrs of 2 and comparing them O(n logn )
- Quick sort: Takes a pivot to make all elements before it lower than the pivot and above it bigger than it O(n**2)
